# Code Style Guide

## General Principles
1. **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names.
2. **Simplicity**: Strive for simplicity in your design and implementation. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
3. **Consistency**: Follow a consistent style throughout the project, including naming conventions and file structure.

## Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: Use `snake_case` for variable names (e.g., `total_count`, `user_list`).
- **Functions**: Use `snake_case` for function names (e.g., `calculate_average`, `fetch_data`).
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).
- **Classes**: Use `CamelCase` for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `DataProcessor`).

## Functions
1. **Pure Functions**: Aim to write pure functions that do not cause side effects and always return the same output for the same input.
2. **Small Functions**: Keep functions small and focused on a single task. If a function is doing too much, break it down into smaller functions.
3. **Function Arguments**: Limit the number of arguments to a function. If a function requires many arguments, consider grouping them into a single object or data structure.

## Code Structure
- **Modules**: Organize code into modules that encapsulate related functionality. Each module should have a clear responsibility.
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive file names that reflect the contents (e.g., `data_processing.py`, `model_training.py`).

## Comments and Documentation
1. **Docstrings**: Use docstrings to document all public functions and classes. Include a brief description, parameters, and return values.
   ```python
   def fetch_data(source: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
       """
       Fetch data from the given source.
       
       Args:
           source (str): The data source URL or path.
       
       Returns:
           List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of records retrieved from the source.
       """
2. Inline Comments: Use inline comments sparingly to explain complex logic. Avoid obvious comments.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all public functions. Aim for high test coverage.
- **Naming Tests**: Use descriptive names for test functions (e.g., test_calculate_average_with_positive_numbers).

## Error Handling
- **Exceptions**: Use exceptions to handle errors. Avoid using return values for error handling.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Create custom exception classes when appropriate to provide more context about errors.

## Functional Programming Practices
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures to avoid side effects and make reasoning about code easier.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Utilize higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions) to promote code reusability.
- **List Comprehensions**: Use list comprehensions for concise and readable iteration and transformation of lists.
    ```
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # Use list comprehensions for simple transformations.
    ```
